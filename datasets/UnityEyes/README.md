# UnityEyes

UnityEyes is a synthetic dataset used to train the ELG CNN for eye region landmarks localization.

The published code and software can be found at https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/

Please download the software and generate images such that there exists the folder `imgs/` when you are done.

The more images you generate, the more robust the trained neural network would be.
